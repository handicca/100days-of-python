# 100 Days of Python

Welcome to the **100 Days of Python** repository! This repository documents my journey of learning Python by completing coding challenges, projects, and exercises over 100 days. The goal is to improve my programming skills, build real-world projects, and solidify my understanding of Python.

## 🚀 About the Challenge

This challenge is inspired by the idea of consistent practice over time to master Python. Each day, I tackle a new topic, solve problems, or build small projects, focusing on the following key areas:

- Python fundamentals
- Object-oriented programming
- Data structures and algorithms
- Web development
- Automation scripts
- Data analysis and visualization
- And much more!

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** (main language)
- Libraries and tools as needed, such as:
  - Various libraries and frameworks (details will be added as I progress)

## 🌟 Goals

1. Build a strong foundation in Python programming.
2. Solve real-world problems using Python.
3. Learn to use Python libraries effectively.
4. Develop projects that showcase my skills.
5. Foster consistency and discipline in learning.
