    Calculate the total value of cards in a blackjack game.

    Args:
    cards (list): A list containing the values of each card in the blackjack game.

    Returns:
    int: The total value of the cards in the blackjack game.

    Explanation:
    This function takes a list containing the values of cards in a blackjack game
    and returns the total value of those cards. If the total card value is 21
    and the number of cards is 2, the function returns 0 (natural blackjack).
    If there is an Ace card with a value of 11 and the total card value exceeds
    21, the value of the Ace card will be changed to 1. After that, the function
    returns the total value of the cards.
